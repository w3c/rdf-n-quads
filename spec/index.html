  <p>N-Quads is a line-based, plain text format for encoding an <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-dataset">RDF dataset</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id='sotd'>
  <p>This document is part of the RDF 1.2 document suite.
  The N-Quads format is a line-based RDF syntax,
  which is an extension of N-Triples [[RDF12-N-TRIPLES]].
  The main distinction is that N-Quads allows the encoding of multiple graphs
  in a single document representing an <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-dataset">RDF Dataset</a>.</p>

  <section id="related" data-include="./common/related.html"></section>

<section id="sec-intro">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    This document defines N-Quads, a concrete syntax for 
    RDF [[RDF12-CONCEPTS]],
    and an extension of N-Triples [[RDF12-N-TRIPLES]].
    N-Quads is an easy to parse, line-based,
    concrete syntax for
    <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#section-dataset">RDF Datasets</a>
    [[!RDF12-CONCEPTS]].
  </p>

  <p>As with N-Triples, an N-Quads document contains no parsing directives.</p>

  <p>N-Quads statements are a sequence of RDF terms representing the
    <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-subject">subject</a>,
    <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-predicate">predicate</a>, and
    <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-object">object</a>
    of an <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-triple">RDF Triple</a>
    and an optional <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-graph-name">graph name</a>
    identifying a <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-named-graph">named graph</a>
    associated with the triple within an <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-dataset">RDF dataset</a>,
    also known as a <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-quad">quad</a>.
    These may be separated by white space (spaces <code>#x20</code> or tabs <code>#x9</code>).
    This sequence is terminated by a '<code>.</code>'
    (optionally proceded by white space and/or a comment),
    and a new line (optional at the end of a document).</p>

  <pre id="ex-comments" class="example nquads" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Use of comments in N-Quads">

  <p>The <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-dataset">RDF dataset</a> represented by an N-Quads document contains
    exactly each <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-quad">quad</a> matching the N-Quads

  <h2>N-Quads Language</h2>

  <p>An N-Quads document allows writing down an
    <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-dataset">RDF dataset</a>
    in a textual form.
    An RDF dataset is made up of <a href="#simple-triples">simple statements</a>
    consisting of a
    <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-subject">subject</a>,
    <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-predicate">predicate</a>,
    <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-object">object</a>, an optional
    <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-graph-name">graph name</a>
    and optional <a>blank lines</a>.
    Comments may be given after a '<code>#</code>' that is not part of
    another lexical token and continue to the end of the line.</p>

  <section id="simple-triples">
    <h3>Simple Statements</h3>

    <p>A simple statement extends the
      <a data-cite="RDF12-N-TRIPLES#simple-triples">definition of simple triple</a> in [[RDF12-N-TRIPLES]]
      with an optional <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-named-graph">named graph</a>.</p>

    <p>The simplest statement is a sequence of
      (<a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-subject">subject</a>,
      <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-predicate">predicate</a>,
      <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-object">object</a>) terms
      forming an <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-triple">RDF triple</a>
      and an optional
      <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-graph-name">graph name</a>
      (a <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-blank-node-label">blank node label</a>
      or <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-iri">IRI</a>) labeling what
      <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-named-graph">named graph</a>
      in a <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-dataset">dataset</a> the triple belongs to.
      White space (spaces <code>U+0020</code> or tabs <code>U+0009</code>) may surround terms,
      except where significant as noted in the <a href="#n-quads-grammar">grammar</a>.</p>

    <p>Comments are treated as white space, and may be given after a '<code>#</code>' that is not part of
      another lexical token and continue to the end of the line.</p>

    <p>The <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-graph-name">graph name</a> can be omitted, in which case the triples are considered
      part of the
      <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-default-graph">default graph</a> of the <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-dataset">RDF dataset</a>.<p>

    <h3>IRIs</h3>

    <p>
      As in N-Triples, <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#iri">IRIs</a> may be written only as absolute IRIs.
      IRIs are enclosed in '&lt;' and '&gt;' and may contain numeric escape sequences (described below).
      For example <code>&lt;http://example.org/#green-goblin&gt;</code>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="sec-literals">
    <h3>RDF Literals</h3>

    <p>As in N-Triples,
      <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#literal">literals</a> are used to identify values such as strings, numbers, dates.</p>

    <p>The representation of the lexical form consists of an
      initial delimiter <code>&quot;</code> (<span class="codepoint">U+0022</span>),
      a sequence of permitted characters or numeric escape sequence or string escape sequence,
      and a final delimiter.</p>

    <p>Literals may not contain the characters <code>&quot;</code>,
      <code title="LINE FEED"><sub>LF</sub></code> (<span class="codepoint">U+000A</span>), or
      <code title="CARRIAGE RETURN"><sub>CR</sub></code> (<span class="codepoint">U+000D</span>)
      except in their escaped forms.
      In addition '<code>\</code>' (<span class="codepoint">U+005C</span>)
      may not appear in any quoted literal except as part of an escape sequence
      and a <code>"</code> (<span class="codepoint">U+0022</span>) character
      can only be included in a quote literal using an escape sequence.
      </p>

    <p>The corresponding <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-lexical-form">RDF lexical form</a>
      is the characters between the delimiters, after processing any escape sequences.
      If present, the <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-language-tag">language tag</a>
      is preceded by a '<code>@</code>' (<span class="codepoint">U+0040</span>).
      If there is no language tag, there may be a <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-datatype-iri">datatype IRI</a>,
      preceded by '<code>^^</code>' (<span class="codepoint">U+005E</span> <span class="codepoint">U+005E</span>).
      If there is no datatype IRI and no language tag
      it is a <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-simple-literal">simple literal</a>
      and the datatype is <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string</code>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="BNodes">
    <h3>RDF Blank Nodes</h3>
    <p>
      As in N-Triples,
      <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-blank-node">RDF blank nodes</a> are expressed as <code>_:</code>
      followed by a blank node label which is a series of name characters.
      The characters in the label are built upon <a href="#grammar-production-PN_CHARS_BASE">PN_CHARS_BASE</a>,
      liberalized as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The characters <code>_</code> and <code>[0-9]</code> may appear anywhere in a blank node label.</li>
      <li>The character <code>.</code> may appear anywhere except the first or last character.</li>
      <li>The characters <code>-</code>, <code>U+00B7</code>, <code>U+0300</code> to <code>U+036F</code> and <code>U+203F</code> to <code>U+2040</code> are permitted anywhere except the first character.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A fresh RDF blank node is allocated for each unique blank node label in a document.
      Repeated use of the same blank node label identifies the same RDF blank node.

<section id="canonical-quads">
  <h2>A Canonical form of N-Quads</h2>

  <p>This section defines a canonical form of N-Quads which has
    less variability in layout.
    The grammar for the language is the same.</p>

  <p class="note">A canonical form of N-Quads can be used to ensure
    that variations in the syntactic representation of terms
    within that quad is determined; each code point
    can be represented by only one of
    <code><a href="#grammar-production-UCHAR">UCHAR</a></code>,
    <code><a href="#grammar-production-ECHAR">ECHAR</a></code>,
    or unencoded character,
    where the relevant production allows for a choice in representation.</p>

  <p>Canonical N-Quads has the following additional constraints on layout:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>White space MUST NOT be used except after
      <code>subject</code>,
      <code>predicate</code>, 
      <code>object</code>,
      and <code>graphLabel</code>
      where it MUST be a single space (<code>U+0020</code>).</li>
    <li><a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#literal">Literals</a> with the
      datatype <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string</code>
      MUST NOT use the datatype IRI part of the <a href="#grammar-production-literal">literal</a>,
      and are represented using only <a href="#grammar-production-STRING_LITERAL_QUOTE">STRING_LITERAL_QUOTE</a>.
    </li>
    <!--li><code><a href="#grammar-production-HEX">HEX</a></code> MUST use only uppercase letters (<code>[A-F]</code>).</li-->
    <li>Characters MUST NOT be represented by <code><a href="#grammar-production-UCHAR">UCHAR</a></code>.</li>
    <li>Within <a href="#grammar-production-STRING_LITERAL_QUOTE">STRING_LITERAL_QUOTE</a>,
      the characters 
      <code>U+0022</code>, <code>U+005C</code>, <code>U+000A</code>, <code>U+000D</code>
       MUST be encoded using <code><a href="#grammar-production-ECHAR">ECHAR</a></code>.
      <code><a href="#grammar-production-ECHAR">ECHAR</a></code> MUST NOT be used for characters that are
      allowed directly in
      <code><a href="#grammar-production-STRING_LITERAL_QUOTE">STRING_LITERAL_QUOTE</a></code>. </li>
      <li>The token <code><a href="#grammar-production-EOL">EOL</a></code> MUST be a single <code>U+000A</code>.</li>
      <li>The final <code><a href="#grammar-production-EOL">EOL</a></code> MUST be provided.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="issue" data-number="16">
    <p>Re-consider the use of `UCHAR` and `ECHAR` escapes in N-Triples/N-Quads canonicalization.
      The 1.1-based recommendation prohibits the use of `UCHAR` (`U+XXXX`)
      and allows `ECHAR` only for `U+0022` (quote `\"`),
      `U+005C` (backslash `\\`),
      `U+000A` (<code title="LINE FEED"><sub>LF</sub></code> `\n`),
      and `U+000D` (<code title="CARRIAGE RETURN"><sub>CR</sub></code> `\r`).
      However, the use of control characters can obfuscate text when presented,
      creating a potential security concern.</p>

    <p>A future version may consider requiring all characters between
      `U+0000` and `U+001F` (other than `U+000A` (<code title="LINE FEED"><sub>LF</sub></code>)
      and `U+000D` (<code title="CARRIAGE RETURN"><sub>CR</sub></code>))
      along with `U+007F` <code title="delete">DEL</code>

    it might be presented through a user agent, which may cause the presented text to

  <p>N-Quads is a general-purpose assertion language;
    applications may evaluate given data to infer more assertions or to dereference <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-iri">IRIs</a>,
    invoking the security considerations of the scheme for that IRI.
    Note in particular, the privacy issues in [[RFC3023]] section 10 for HTTP IRIs.
    Data obtained from an inaccurate or malicious data source may lead to inaccurate or misleading conclusions,
    as well as the dereferencing of unintended IRIs.
    Care must be taken to align the trust in consulted resources with the sensitivity of

    inferences of potential medical treatments would likely require different trust than inferences

  <p>The N-Quads language is used to express arbitrary application data;

    Security tools and protocols applicable to text
    (for example, PGP encryption, checksum validation, password-protected compression)

  <p>N-Quads can express data which is presented to the user, such as RDF Schema labels.
    Applications rendering strings retrieved from untrusted N-Quads documents,
    or using unescaped characters,

  <p>Multiple <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-iri">IRIs</a> may have the same appearance.
    Characters in different scripts may look similar (for instance,
    a Cyrillic &quot;&#1086;&quot; may appear similar to a Latin &quot;o&quot;).
    A character followed by combining characters may have the same visual representation

        <a href="https://sw.deri.org/2008/07/n-quads/"
           >N-Quads: Extending N-Triples with Context</a>,
        proposed the use of media type <code>text/x-nquads</code> with an encoding
        using 7-bit US-ASCII.</p>

  <h3>N-Quads Grammar</h3>

  <p>An N-Quads document is a Unicode [[!UNICODE]] character string encoded in UTF-8.</p>

  <section id="sec-grammar-ws">
    <h3>White Space</h3>

    <p>White space (tab U+0009 or space U+0020) is allowed outside of terminals.
      Rule names below in capitals indicate where white space is significant.
</p>

    <p>White space is significant in the production <a href="#grammar-production-STRING_LITERAL_QUOTE">STRING_LITERAL_QUOTE</a>.</p>

    <p>A <dfn class="no=export">blank line</dfn>, consisting of only white space and/or a comment,
      may appear wherever a <code><a href="#grammar-production-statement">statement</a></code> production is allowed,
      and are treated as white space.</p>

    <p class="note">As with, N-Triples [[RDF12-N-TRIPLES]],
      N-Quads allows only horizontal white space  (tab U+0009 or space U+0020).</p>
  </section>

  <section id="sec-grammar-comments">
    <h3>Comments</h3>

    <p>Comments in N-Quads start at '<code>#</code>'
      outside an <a href="#grammar-production-IRIREF">IRIREF</a> or <a href="#grammar-production-STRING_LITERAL_QUOTE">STRING_LITERAL_QUOTE</a>,
      and continue to the end of line
      (marked by characters
      <code title="CARRIAGE RETURN"><sub>CR</sub></code> (<span class="codepoint">U+000D</span> or
      <code title="LINE FEED"><sub>LF</sub></code> (<span class="codepoint">U+000A</span>))
      or end of file if there is no end of line after the comment
      marker.
      Comments are treated as white space.</p>

    <h3>Grammar</h3>

    <p>The <abbr title="Extended Backus–Naur Form">EBNF</abbr> used
      here is defined in XML 1.0 [[EBNF-NOTATION]].</p>

    <p>Escape sequence rules are the same as N-Triples [[RDF12-N-TRIPLES]] and Turtle [[RDF12-TURTLE]].
      However, as only the <a href="#grammar-production-STRING_LITERAL_QUOTE"><code>STRING_LITERAL_QUOTE</code></a>
      production is allowed new lines in literals MUST be escaped.</p>

    <h3>RDF Dataset Construction</h3>
    <p>An N-Quads document defines an <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-dataset">RDF dataset</a>

      <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-triple">RDF triples</a>.
      The  <code><a href="#grammar-production-statement">statement</a></code> production produces a
      triple defined by the terms constructed for
      <code><a href="#grammar-production-subject">subject</a></code>,
      <code><a href="#grammar-production-predicate">predicate</a></code>, and
      <code><a href="#grammar-production-object">object</a></code>.
      This RDF triple is added to the <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-named-graph">graph</a> labeled by
      the production <code><a href="#grammar-production-graphLabel">graphLabel</a></code>,
      if no <code>graphLabel</code> is present the triple is added to the RDF dataset's default graph.</p>

  <h2>Changes between RDF 1.1 and RDF 1.2</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>N-Quads is now described as an extension of N-Triples [[RDF12-N-TRIPLES]].</li>
    <li>Add <a href="#canonical-quads" class="sectionRef"></a> to define the canonical form of N-Quads.</li>
    <li>Better align the use of white space and comments with [[RDF12-TURTLE]].</li>
    <li>Removed language about white space use between terminals that would otherwise
      be (mis-)recognized, is this can't happen in N-Triples.</li>
    <li>Clarify the use of <a>blank lines</a>, including those composed of white space
      and/or comments.
      Comments can appear at the end of a triple before the newline as
      was already evident from <a href="#ex-comments"></a>.</li>
    <li>Create separate subsections of <a href="#n-quads-grammar"></a>
      for <a href="#sec-grammar-ws">White space</a> and
      <a href="#sec-grammar-comments">Comments</a>,
      better mirroring [[RDF12-TURTLE]].</li>
    <li>Updated the <a href="#grammar-production-PN_CHARS_U">PN_CHARS_U</a>
      grammar production to be consistent with with Turtle.
      Formerly, <a href="#grammar-production-PN_CHARS_U">PN_CHARS_U</a>
      included "`:`" in N-Triples and N-Quads, but not in Turtle and TriG.
      <a href="#grammar-production-PN_CHARS_U">PN_CHARS_U</a> is a component
      of <a href="#grammar-production-PN_CHARS_U">BLANK_NODE_LABEL</a>.</li>
    <li>Separated <a href="#security"></a> from <a href="#sec-mediatype"></a>
